  - name: Collections
    description: |-
      Collections allow a client to discover available resources in a way that is conformant with OGC API Features
      and OGC API Common.
      
      All Connected Systems resource types are always available through their canonical collections at the service root,
      but OGC API Collections provide an additional way of grouping and accessing these resources.
      In particular, Collections allow a service provider to group resources logically according to any criteria.
      
      For example, collections can be used to:
        - Group all `Systems` of the same type (e.g. all UAV platforms, all hydrological sensors, etc.).
        - Group all `Procedures` of the same type (e.g. all platform types, all CBRNE sensor models, etc.).
        - Group resources by project (e.g. all `Deployments`, `Systems`, `Datastreams` and `Sampling Features` relevant to a given data acquisition campaign)

  - name: Systems
    description: |-
      Systems are entities that can produce data feeds and/or receive commands (e.g. sensors and sensor networks, platforms, actuators,
      processing components, etc.). Many systems can be classified as 'observing systems' that produce observations of one or more
      features of interest.
  - name: Procedures
    description: |-
      Procedures provides information about the procedure implemented by a system to accomplish its task(s).
      For hardware equipment, it usually corresponds to the equipment's datasheet.
      For human sensing or sampling tasks, the procedure describes the steps or methodology that must be followed by the operator.
  - name: Deployments
    description: |-
      Deployments describe how systems are being deployed at a particular place and time.
  - name: Sampling Features
    description: |-
      Sampling Features link Systems with ultimate features of interest, describing exactly what part of a larger feature is being
      interacted with.
  - name: Properties
    description: |-
      Property resources provide the definitions of derived properties that are used throughout the API.
      
      Derived properties are specific to a type of feature, a type of system, or even to a particular organization, project or deployment.
      Property definitions are referenced by feature schemas, system and deployment descriptions, datastream and control stream schemas, etc.
      
      Depending on the context they are used in, they can represent properties that are asserted (e.g. system characteristic), observed
      (observed or observable property) or controlled (controlled or controllable property).
