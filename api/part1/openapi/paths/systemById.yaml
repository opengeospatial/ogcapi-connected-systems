get:
  summary: Retrieve a system description by ID
  description: |-
    This will return the latest description of the system valid before or at the current time, by default.

    If system history is supported by the server, descriptions of the system valid at past (or future) time
    can be accessed using the `datetime` parameter or through the `history` sub-collection.

put:
  summary: Update a system description
  description: |-
    This will completely replace the existing description of the system with the provided content.
    
    If system history is supported and the `validTime` property starts after the time of the previous description,
    the provided description becomes the current one and all previous descriptions are made available via the
    `history` sub collection.

delete:
  summary: Delete a system
  description: |-
    This will delete the system and remove it from all collections it is associated to.

    If the `cascade` parameter is used, all associated sub-resources hosted by the same server
    (sampling features, datastreams, command streams, observations, and commmands) are also deleted.

    If system history is supported, all historical descriptions are deleted as well.
