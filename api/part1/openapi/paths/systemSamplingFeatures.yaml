  summary: Create new sampling features
  description: |-
    Add one or more new `Sampling Feature` resources. Sampling features are always created inside, and thus attached to a parent system.

    Note that it is possible to create multiple resources in a single batch request.
    In this case, several resource descriptions are provided in the content body inside a JSON array.
    On success, the server will send a `200` response with the list of URIs of all created resources,
    in the same order as the array in the request.
