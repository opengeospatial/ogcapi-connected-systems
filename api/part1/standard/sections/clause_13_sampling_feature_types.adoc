== Requirements Classes for Sampling Feature Types

=== Overview

This section specifies requirements for several types of `Sampling Features` that can be used to document different sampling strategies. More sampling feature types can be defined by extensions.

See the <<clause-encodings,Encoding Requirements Classes>> for examples of `Sampling Feature` resource representations. 



[[clause-sf-spatial]]
=== Requirements Class "Spatial Sampling Features"

==== Overview
include::../requirements/sampling/requirements_class_sampling_spatial.adoc[]

`Spatial Sampling Features` are generic sampling features with a sampling location or geometry, in one, two or three dimensions. They are used when no physical sample is collected and observations are made directly on a spatial subset of the sampled feature (e.g. an in-situ measurement station, a profile through a gaseous or liquid medium, an image footprint, etc.). The original model for these feature types is defined as part of <<OGC-OM, Observations and Measurements v2.0>>.

NOTE: The `Spatial Sampling Features` introduced in this section are best used for modeling static or slowly moving features. Although it is possible to handle dynamic use cases using these classes, it requires posting a new feature to the server everytime the location of the feature changes. This can be very inefficient for highly mobile sampling features such as the ones attached to moving platforms or rotating sensors (e.g PTZ cams). Parametric sampling features defined in <<clause-sf-parametric>> are better suited for these use cases since they can be positioned relatively to a moving platform.

NOTE: However, even for mobile cases, `Spatial Sampling Features` can be useful if capturing a different feature for each new observation is desired. For instance, this is the case for space-borne earth observation where the geographic footprint of each acquisition is typically provided along with the collected imagery.

Below are a few examples for each sub-type of `Spatial Sampling Feature`:

[[clause-sf-feature-parts]]
=== Requirements Class "Feature Parts"

==== Overview
include::../requirements/sampling/requirements_class_sampling_feature_part.adoc[]

`Feature Parts` are used to clearly identify the part of a feature that is being observed or controlled within a larger feature. They are useful to provide more details about the sampling or control point when the part is not itself already described as a feature object. 

NOTE: Feature parts are particularly useful when the feature of interest is a `System` resource. They allow to precisely identify what part of the system is being observed or controlled (e.g. the wing of an aircraft, the engine of a car, etc.)

NOTE: Since this API does not allow linking an observation to the ultimate feature of interest directly, `Feature Parts` can also be used as a proxy to refer to an existing feature of interest as a whole. This is especially useful when referring to ultimate features of interest that are hosted on third party servers.

[example%unnumbered]
====
*Examples of Feature Parts*

- The CPU in a computer or robot
- The center of mass of a UAV
- The antenna of a GPS receiver
- The vent of an A/C system
- A room or door in a building

[[clause-sf-parametric]]
=== Requirements Class "Parametric Sampling Features"

==== Overview
include::../requirements/sampling/requirements_class_sampling_parametric.adoc[]

Parametric sampling features are special kinds of spatial sampling features whose geometry is defined implicitely by a certain number of parameters, rather than by vertex coordinates. These parameters include extrinsic parameters defining the pose of the feature relative to a coordinate frame of reference (outer frame), and intrinsic parameters defining the shape of the feature in its own coordinate frame (inner frame).

One advantage of parametric sampling features is their capability for relative positioning via the `pose` attribute. Since they can be positionned relatively to a moving object, their parameters don't need to be updated frequently when the object moves. Rather, the sampling feature would "track" the object automatically.

All parametric sampling features share some requirements that are detailed below.

==== Attributes

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/sampling/parametric/attributes

part:: A `Parametric Sampling Feature` resource SHALL support the attributes listed in <<sf-parametric-attributes>>.

part:: The value assigned to these attributes SHALL conform to the specified definition and data type.

part:: All attributes marked as `Required` SHALL be present on an instance of the class.
====

[#sf-parametric-attributes,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.Parametric Sampling Feature Attributes
[width="100%",cols="4,10,3,3",options="header"]
|====
| *Name*  | *Definition* | *Data Type* | *Usage*
| `pose`  | The pose of the sampling feature, relative to the base reference frame. | Pose | Optional
|====

==== Pose

Every parametric sampling feature has a `pose` attribute that takes an instance of a `Pose` object based on the SensorML Pose model, itself derived from the <<GeoPose,GeoPose>> model.

The `pose` property allows the specification of the feature location and orientation relatively to a frame of reference. More specifically, it provides the pose of the inner frame relative to the outer frame (the frame of reference).

The allowed values for the `pose` attribute are "GeoPose Basic" instances or "SensorML Relative Pose" instances.

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/sampling/parametric/pose

part:: The value of the `pose` attribute SHALL be one of the following:
  - A GeoPose Basic-YPR instance
  - A GeoPose Basic-Quaternion instance
  - A SensorML Relative-YPR instance
  - A SensorML Relative-Quaternion instance
====

When using a GeoPose `Basic-YPR` or `Basic-Quaternion` instance, the position is always a geographic location expressed in the EPSG:4979 (WGS 84, lat/lon/alt) coordinate reference system, and the orientation is relative to the ENU LTP frame located at the geographic location. Thus, this is only suited for static sampling features.

For other use cases (e.g. mobile), a SensorML `Relative-YPR` or `Relative-Quaternion` pose instance is required. In this case, the coordinate frame of reference used to express the pose can be any cartesian coordinate frame, but the most frequently used ones are:

- A local tangent plane (LTP) coordinate frame such as NED or ENU
- An engineering coordinate frame attached to a system (fixed or mobile, e.g. a UAV platform)
- An engineering coordinate frame attached to another feature of interest (e.g. building)

When using the SensorML `Relative-YPR` or `Relative-Quaternion` instance with an LTP frame, the location of the frame is provided by the feature location attribute that takes a point geometry, and the position in the pose is an offset from that location, expressed in the LTP frame (before the rotation).

When an LTP coordinate frame is used, the location property of the sampling feature is used to indicate the point in space where the LTP is located (typically a geographic location).

==== Location

#The location can be used as the default point location for clients that don't understand the extended properties.#



[[clause-sf-sampling-point-xyz]]
=== Requirements Class "Relative Sampling Point"

==== Overview
include::../requirements/sampling/requirements_class_sampling_relative_point.adoc[]

The `Relative Sampling Point` class allows to define a sampling point relatively to a cartesian reference frame.

[example%unnumbered]
====
*Relative Sampling Points Examples*

- X/Y/Z position relative to a surface location, expressed in the ENU local tangent frame
- X/Y/Z position relative to a moving platform (e.g. under water sampling point on a USV)
====

The orientation part of the pose is not used in the `Relative Sampling Point` class and it is illegal to provide it.

[[clause-sf-sampling-profile]]
=== Requirements Class "Sampling Profile"

==== Overview
include::../requirements/sampling/requirements_class_sampling_profile.adoc[]

A `Sampling Profile` is used when measurements are taken at various distances along a straight line, at regular or irregular intervals. 

The location of the profile "bins" is defined relatively to the origin of the profile, which makes it suitable for profiles attached to moving platforms.

NOTE: Although a `SamplingCurve` feature can be used to model a profile, it requires the specification of the 3D location of each profile bin, separately. This makes it quite inefficient when ingesting data for mobile profilers. But note that it can still be used to read the data back as the `SamplingCurve` feature can be reconstructed dynamically knowing the platform location and sampling profile parameters. 

[example%unnumbered]
====
*Examples of Sampling Profiles*

- Sampling at various depth within a borehole
- Sampling at various depth by an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) attached to an ocean buoy
