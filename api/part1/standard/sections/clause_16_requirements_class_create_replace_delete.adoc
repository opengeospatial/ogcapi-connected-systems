== Requirements Class "Create/Replace/Delete"

=== Overview
include::../requirements/crud/requirements_class_crd.adoc[]

The "Create/Replace/Delete" requirements class specifies how instances of the resource types defined in this Standard are created, replaced and deleted via a CS API endpoint.

All resources are created, replaced and deleted using CREATE (HTTP POST), REPLACE (HTTP PUT) and DELETE (HTTP DELETE) operations, respectively, as defined by the {ogcapi-features-4} Standard.

{ogcapi-features-4} uses the terms "resources endpoint" and "resource endpoint" to identify the paths where these operations are supported by the server. The following sections provide these endpoints for each resource type defined by the CS API Standard.


=== Systems

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/create-replace-delete/system

conditions:: The server implements <<clause-system-features,style=basic%>>

part:: The server SHALL support the CREATE operation at the `System` resources endpoints defined by the following URI template:
  - `{api_root}/systems`

part:: The server SHALL support the REPLACE and DELETE operations at the `System` resources endpoints defined by the following URI template:
  - `{api_root}/systems/{id}`

part:: The `id` parameter SHALL be the local identifier of the `System` resource to replace or delete.
====

The following constraints must be implemented by the server.

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/create-replace-delete/system-delete-cascade

conditions:: The server implements <<clause-system-features,style=basic%>>

part:: By default (`cascade` parameter is not set), the server SHALL reject a DELETE request on a `System` resource that has nested resources (i.e., subsystems, sampling features, datastreams, control streams) or is associated with a deployment.

part:: If the request contains the `cascade` parameter, the server SHALL accept the DELETE request and delete the `System` resource as well as all its nested resources.

part:: If the `System` resource is associated with a `Deployment` resource, the `Deployment` resource SHALL be be updated, removing the link to the System.
====


=== Subsystems

Subsystems (i.e., system components) can only be created as sub-resources of a parent system, but are updated/deleted at their canonical URL just like any other `System` resource.

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/create-replace-delete/subsystem

conditions:: The server implements <<clause-subsystems,style=basic%>>

part:: The server SHALL support the CREATE operation at the `System` resources endpoints defined by the following URI template:
  - `{api_root}/systems/{parentId}/subsystems`

part:: The operation SHALL result in the creation of a new `System` and its association with the `System` system with id `parentId`.
====

NOTE: There is no operation to "move" a subsystem from one parent to another. To achieve this, the client must first delete the subsystem at its canonical URI and recreate it under another parent system.


=== Deployments

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/create-replace-delete/deployment

conditions:: The server implements <<clause-deployment-features,style=basic%>>

part:: The server SHALL support the CREATE operation at the `Deployment` resources endpoints defined by the following URI template:
  - `{api_root}/deployments`

part:: The server SHALL support the REPLACE and DELETE operations at the `Deployment` resources endpoints defined by the following URI template:
  - `{api_root}/deployments/{id}`

part:: The `id` parameter SHALL be the local identifier of the `Deployment` resource to replace or delete.
====


=== Subdeployments

Subdeployments can only be created as sub-resources of a parent deployment, but are updated/deleted at their canonical URL just like any other `Deployment` resource.

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/create-replace-delete/subdeployment

conditions:: The server implements <<clause-subdeployments,style=basic%>>

part:: The server SHALL support the CREATE operation at the `Deployment` resources endpoints defined by the following URI template:
  - `{api_root}/deployments/{parentId}/subdeployments`

part:: The operation SHALL result in the creation of a new `Deployment` and its association with the parent `Deployment` with id `parentId`.
====


=== Procedures

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/create-replace-delete/procedure

conditions:: The server implements <<clause-procedure-features,style=basic%>>

part:: The server SHALL support the CREATE operation at the `Procedure` resources endpoints defined by the following URI template:
  - `{api_root}/procedures`

part:: The server SHALL support the REPLACE and DELETE operations at the `Procedure` resources endpoints defined by the following URI template:
  - `{api_root}/procedures/{id}`

part:: The `id` parameter SHALL be the local identifier of the `Procedure` resource to replace or delete.
====


=== Sampling Features

`Sampling Features` are created as sub-resources of a parent system.

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/create-replace-delete/sampling-feature

conditions:: The server implements <<clause-sampling-features,style=basic%>>

part:: The server SHALL support the CREATE operation at the `Sampling Feature` resources endpoints defined by the following URI template:
  - `{api_root}/systems/{sysId}/samplingFeatures`

part:: The server SHALL support the REPLACE and DELETE operations at the `Sampling Feature` resources endpoints defined by the following URI templates:
  - `{api_root}/samplingFeatures/{id}`

part::  The `sysId` parameter SHALL be the local identifier of the parent `System` resource that the new sampling feature will be attached to. +
        The `id` parameter SHALL be the local identifier of the `Sampling Feature` resource to replace or delete.
====


=== Property Definitions

`Property` resources are created, replaced and deleted using HTTP POST, PUT and DELETE operations, respectively.

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/create-replace-delete/property

conditions:: The server implements <<clause-derived-properties,style=basic%>>

part:: The server SHALL support the CREATE operation at the `Property` resources endpoints defined by the following URI template:
  - `{api_root}/properties`

part:: The server SHALL support the REPLACE and DELETE operations at the `Property` resources endpoints defined by the following URI template:
  - `{api_root}/properties/{id}`

part:: The `id` parameter SHALL be the local identifier of the `Property` resource to replace or delete.
====


=== Custom Collections

This clause defines the expected behavior of the server when Resource Collections other than the root collections are exposed by the server (this causes the same resource to be accessible via multiple collections simultaneously).

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/create-replace-delete/create-in-collection

part:: When a resource defined in the CS API Standard is successfully created by the server at any endpoint, the server SHALL always make it available in the root collection corresponding to the resource type.
====

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/create-replace-delete/replace-in-collection

part:: If a resource is successfully replaced by the server, the server SHALL reflect this change in all other collections that the resource is part of.
====

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/create-replace-delete/delete-in-collection

part:: If a resource is deleted from a root collection, the server SHALL also delete it from all other collections that the resource is part of.

part:: If a resource is deleted from a collection other than the root collection, the server SHALL only delete it from this collection.
====

Adding existing resources to one or more custom collections is done by posting a list of resource URIs to the collection endpoint.

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/create-replace-delete/add-to-collection

part:: The server SHALL support adding existing resources to a collection by reference.

part:: The `Content-Type` header of the request SHALL be set to `text/uri-list`.

part:: The body of the POST request SHALL contain the list of URIs of resources that need to be added to the collection, formatted with one URI per line (see https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/uri-list).

part:: All URIs included in the content body SHALL be canonical URLs or unique identifiers (UID) of resources available at the same API endpoint.
