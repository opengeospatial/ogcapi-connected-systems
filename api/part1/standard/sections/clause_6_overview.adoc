== Overview
=== General

OGC Web API Standards enable access to resources using the HTTP protocol and its associated operations (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc.). 

OGC API - Connected Systems Standard - Part 1 (aka “this Standard” or “CS API”) defines resource types that allow the provision of metadata about all kinds of devices, hardware components or processes that can transmit and/or receive data via communication networks (a.k.a. connected systems), including sensors, platforms, robots, human observers, forecast models, computer simulations, etc.

This Standard is an extension of the {ogcapi-features} Standard and defines specific feature collections, feature types and filtering mechanisms that are also dependent on building blocks from the {ogcapi-common} Standard. Therefore, an implementation of this Standard shall first satisfy the appropriate Requirements Classes from these two Standards. In addition, this Standard has dependencies on some OGC and non-OGC encoding standards. All dependencies are clearly identified in each Requirements Class.


=== Design Considerations

While this is the first version of the OGC API - Connected Systems series, the fine-grained access to sensor related data, including sensor metadata, observations and tasking over the Web has been supported by the <<OGC-SOS,OGC Sensor Observation Service (SOS)>>, <<OGC-SPS,OGC Sensor Planning Service (SPS)>> and <<OGC-STA-1,SensorThings API>> Standards and their various implementations for many years.

SOS and SPS were designed in the early 2000s and use a Remote-Procedure-Call-over-HTTP architectural style and XML for any payloads, while the SensorThings API Standard is a newer OGC Standard that was the first to adopt the REST architecture style with JSON payloads.

Requirements in the OGC API - Connected Systems Standard (CS API) support all capabilities from these previous Standards, but using a modernized approach that follows the current Web architecture and in particular the W3C/OGC best practices for sharing Spatial Data on the Web as well as the latest OGC API guidelines.

The CS API is designed as an extension of the {ogcapi-features} Standard which makes it entirely compatible with Features API clients, while still allowing more advanced functionality to access dynamic data associated to features. A clear goal of this approach is to better integrate the GIS and sensor/IoT communities. 

Another key design decision was to allow linking to implementations of other OGC API Standards whenever possible, thus allowing a much better integration with the rest of the OGC API ecosystem.

Models from the {ogc-w3c-ssn} are the basis for the design of the CS API, and the <<OGC-SML,SensorML>> language is used as an implementation model to provide concrete implementations of the SOSA/SSN concepts. An alternative GeoJSON encoding of these concepts is also defined.

The CS API defines several resource/feature types in separate requirements classes, any combination of which can be implemented by the server. This allows resources to be distributed across several servers (potentially different implementations of the CS API) and connected via hyperlinks. For example, a given implementation can choose to implement only `System` and `Deployment` features and rely on other servers to host complementary metadata such as `Procedures`, `Property Definitions` and `Features of Interest` (i.e., domain features). This is a common use cases since procedure descriptions (i.e., system datasheets) and domain features (e.g., geographical or hydrological features) can typically be shared by many different organizations.

The CS API also help solve several issues for application running in Denied, Disrupted, Intermittent, and Limited (DDIL) environments, e.g., under tactical implementation conditions. This includes:

- Reduction of payload sizes in contrast to predecessor standards (OGC SOS and OGC SPS) by using a resource oriented JSON API instead of remote procedure calls with XML payloads;
- SWE Common encoding supported by the OGC API - Connected Systems - Part 2: Dynamic data allows the separation of datastream schemas from actual data values which helps to reduce payload size compared to other encoding standards;
- Pub/Sub protocols supported by OGC API - Connected Systems - Part 3: Pub/Sub will help track changes and only download changes when required, or receive new data without continuous polling; and
-  OGC API - Connected Systems - Part 5: Binary Encoding will add even more compact encodings such as FlatGeobuf for feature resources or Protobuf and FlatBuffers for observations and commands.


=== Resource Types

All resources defined in Part 1 of this Standard are feature types, except for the `Property Definition` resource. Each resource type is defined in its own requirements class. The table below provides an overview of these resource types:

[#feature-types,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.Overview of resource types defined by this Standard
[width="100%",options="header"]
|====
| *Resource Type*      | *Requirements Class*           | *Description* | *Possible Encodings*
| System (Feature)     | <<clause-system-features>>     | Description of system instances such as sensors, platforms, human observers, etc.  | GeoJSON, SML-JSON
| Deployment (Feature) | <<clause-deployment-features>> | Description of deployments involving one or more systems for a particular purpose. | GeoJSON, SML-JSON
| Procedure (Feature)  | <<clause-procedure-features>>  | Description of procedures implemented by systems such as datasheets or methods (e.g., system types). | GeoJSON, SML-JSON
| Sampling Feature     | <<clause-sampling-features>>   | Description of sampling strategies associated with specific systems (e.g., sampling geometry or method). | GeoJSON
| Property Definition  | <<clause-property-definitions>>  | Description of feature properties (observable properties, controllable properties, system properties). | SML-JSON
|====

NOTE: The listed encodings are the ones defined in this Standard, but extensions can define additional encodings.


=== Resource Encodings

This Standard also defines encodings that can be used to encode the resource types listed above. Support for these encodings is not required as each encoding is specified in its own requirements class.

Encodings are specified in <<clause-encodings>> of this Standard. Each encoding requirements class provides schemas and examples for the supported resource types.


=== Resource Collections

The CS API Standard defines several resource types that are intended to be offered by the server via separate collections. These resource collections are governed by requirements from ogcapi-features-1. Such collections will be referred to as OGC API Collections in the rest of this document.

The CS API makes use of this collection mechanism to allow a server to provide a more organized view of its content, by grouping them into logical collections according to any criteria.

Note that a given resource can be made available through more than one collection endpoints (i.e., collections can overlap). This provides great flexibility for a server to organize resources according to multiple criteria and thus provide different view points to the client simultaneously. See the requirements classes of the different resource types for examples.

When exposing resources via a collection endpoint, the server must indicate the type of the items contained in the collection. This is done using the `itemType` attribute of the collection. For feature collections, the `itemType` is always set to `feature`, so this Standard defines the `featureType` attribute to further specify the type of features contained in the collection.

Heterogeneous feature collections (i.e., collections containing a mix of feature types) are allowed but this Standard does not define the behavior of such collections.


[[clause_api_endpoints]]
=== API Endpoints

As described in the previous clause, all resources defined in the CS API Standard are available through collection endpoints. 

However, the CS API also defines different types of endpoints that are useful for the following use cases:

- Providing a canonical URL for a resource, independently of the collections it is part of,

- Providing a canonical endpoint to add resources of a given type, independently of the collections it will be added to,

- Searching for resources across all collections of a given resource type, and

- Access resources as sub-resources of a parent resource (allows to provide a pre-filtered view of the resources).

==== Endpoint Types

The CS API Standard defines the behavior of "resource**s** endpoints" and "resource endpoints" associated to each resource type defined in the Standard. These endpoints are defined in a way that is independent of the actual endpoint URL so that the same behavior can be reused at different API paths.

The terms "resource**s** endpoint" and "resource endpoint" are used as defined by {ogcapi-features-4}, that is:

- A "resource endpoint" is an API endpoint exposing a single resource; and
- A "resource**s** endpoint" is an API endpoint exposing a set of resources.

Several types of API endpoints are defined by the CS API Standard:

- Canonical resource**s** endpoints (e.g., `{api_root}/systems`)
- Canonical resource endpoints (e.g., `{api_root}/systems/{id}`)
- Nested resource**s** endpoints (e.g., `{api_root}/systems/{id}/subsystems`)
- Collection items resource**s** endpoints (e.g., `{api_root}/collections/{id}/items`)

==== Canonical Resources Endpoints

A canonical resource**s** endpoint exposes all resources of a given type hosted by the server. It provides a default endpoint for creating new resources (using HTTP POST), and retrieving/searching resources (using HTTP GET) of this type. Canonical resource**s** endpoint have simple URLs located directly at the API root.

The canonical resources endpoints for resource types defined in Part 1 of the CS API Standard are:

- `{api_root}/systems`
- `{api_root}/deployments`
- `{api_root}/procedures`
- `{api_root}/samplingFeatures`
- `{api_root}/properties`

==== Canonical Resource Endpoints

A canonical resource endpoint exposes a single resource. It provides a default endpoint for retrieving, replacing, updating or deleting (using HTTP GET, PUT, PATCH and DELETE, respectively) a given resource. Any change to the resource made at its canonical endpoint will be reflected in all collections that the resource is part of.

The canonical URL for a single resource is based on the URL of the canonical resources endpoint of the corresponding resource type. This leads to the following canonical URL templates for resource types defined in Part 1 of the CS API Standard:

- `{api_root}/systems/{id}`
- `{api_root}/deployments/{id}`
- `{api_root}/procedures/{id}`
- `{api_root}/samplingFeatures/{id}`
- `{api_root}/properties/{id}`

When a resource is retrieved from a URL that is NOT its canonical URL (e.g., through a collection), its canonical URL must be provided in the response.

An example of `canonical` link is provided in the following JSON snippet:

[[example_canonical_link]]
[source%unnumbered,json]
----
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "id": "123",
  ...
  "links": [
    {
      "rel" : "self",
      "title" : "this document",
      "href" : "https://data.example.org/api/collections/uav_systems/123?f=json",
      "type" : "application/geo+json"
    }, {
      "rel" : "canonical",
      "title" : "this resource canonical URL",
      "href" : "https://data.example.org/api/systems/123?f=json",
      "type" : "application/geo+json"
    }
  ]
}
----

NOTE: If the response format is not JSON based, the canonical link can still be provided in the HTTP response headers.


=== Paged Responses

All resource collections support paging via the `limit` query parameter and the `next` link, as specified by the {ogcapi-features-1} Standard.


=== Search & Filtering

The core search capability is based on the {ogcapi-features-1} Standard and thus supports:

* Bounding box searches using the `bbox` parameter,
* Time instant or time period searches using the `datetime` parameter, and
* Equality predicates on feature properties (i.e., _property_=_value_).

The CS API Standard extends these core search capabilities to include:

* Search by resource local ID or UID using the `id` parameter,
* Geospatial searches using the `geom` parameter encoded as a WKT geometry, and
* Full-text searches using the `q` parameter (prefix search only).

Additional filters are defined on a per resource type basis, as shown in the following table:

[#query-params,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.Query Parameters
[width="100%",options="header"]
|====
| *Requirements Class*       | *Query Parameters*
| System Features            | `parent`, `procedure`, `foi`, `observedProperty`, `controlledProperty`
| Deployment Features        | `parent`, `system`, `foi`, `observedProperty`, `controlledProperty`
| Procedure Features         | `observedProperty`, `controlledProperty`
| Sampling Features          | `foi`, `observedProperty`, `controlledProperty`
| Property Definitions       | `baseProperty`, `objectType`
|====

[[security_considerations]]
=== Security Considerations

==== Authentication

The expectation is that certain functionality of the CS API will be protected by an access control mechanism (e.g., RBAC), which requires each user to authenticate.

This Standard does not mandate a particular authentication method, but the following methods are commonly used and supported by OpenAPI:

- HTTP authentication (basic, bearer),
- API key (either as a header or as a query parameter),
- OAuth2 Common Flows (implicit, password, application and access code) as defined in RFC6749, and
- OpenID Connect Discovery.

NOTE: Some of these authentication methods are only recommended over HTTPS.

==== Encryption

A CS API implementation will often be used to transmit confidential or sensitive data. Encryption in-transit using HTTPS (i.e., HTTP over TLS/SSL) is thus highly recommended and is now very common practice on the web.

In addition, implementations of this Standard may also store confidential or sensitive data (e.g., in a database) for extended periods of time. In this case, encryption at rest is also recommended, especially if data is hosted on a shared infrastructure (e.g., public clouds).

==== M2M Communications

It is expected that clients implementing the CS API Standard will sometime be machines that connect to the API automatically without human intervention.

To mitigate data spoofing, it is highly recommended that this type of clients use a strong authentication method and digital signatures relying on asymmetric cryptography, and whose access can be easily revoked (e.g., PKI certificates).

==== Common Weaknesses

Please see https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-069r4/17-069r4.html#_security_considerations[Clause 11] of {ogcapi-features-1} for guidance regarding the mitigation of typical web APIs weaknesses.
