== Requirements Class "System Features"

=== Overview
include::../requirements/system/requirements_class_system_features.adoc[]

The "System Features" requirements class specifies how system descriptions are provided using the CS API.

The `System` resource implements the _http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/System[System]_ concept defined in the {ogc-w3c-ssn}. `System` resources are used to expose metadata about several kinds of systems and their components, including sensors, actuators, samplers, processes, platforms, etc.

NOTE: `System` resources describe *system instances* (e.g. a sensor device, a UAV platform) while `Procedure` resources are used to describe *system types* (e.g. a particular model of sensor or vehicle, specified using the manufacturer datasheet). Several `System` instances can implement the same `Procedure` (i.e. be of the same model).

NOTE: `System` resources are used to model all subclasses of _http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/System[sosa:System]_, including _http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Sensor[sosa:Sensor]_, _http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Actuator[sosa:Actuator]_, _http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Sampler[sosa:Sampler]_, as well as _http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Platform[sosa:Platform]_. Semantic tagging is used to provide the exact type.

[[clause-system-resource]]
=== System Resource

==== Introduction

In the CS API Standard, `System` resources are a special kind of feature resource that implements the _http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/System[ssn:System]_ concept.

This section defines the attributes and associations composing a `System` resource, but the exact way they are encoded in the payload is defined by each encoding. For encodings defined in this document, please see:

- <<clause-geojson-system,System resource as GeoJSON>>
- <<clause-sensorml-system,System resource as SensorML>>

==== Properties

The following tables describe the attributes and associations of a `System` resource and their mapping to SOSA/SSN.

All `System` resource representations provided by encoding requirements classes map to these properties.

|====

NOTE: Tagging a `System` resource with a particular type only carries semantic meaning and does not imply any API functionality. All types of systems can receive commands and generate datastreams.

[#asset-types,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.Asset Types
[width="100%",cols="5,10,5,15",options="header"]
|====
| *Asset Type* | *URI* | *CURIE* | *Usage*
| Equipment    | #http://www.opengis.net/def/x-OGC/TBD/Equipment#     | sml:Equipment | The system is composed of one or more hardware devices or pieces of equipment, that interact directly with the real-world and can be either automated or manually operated (e.g. sensor or actuator device, vehicle, robot, etc.).
| Human        | #http://www.opengis.net/def/x-OGC/TBD/Human#         | sml:Human | The system consists of one or more human beings that follow well defined procedures (e.g. conducting polls or surveys, collecting samples, carrying sensors, etc.). 
| Living Thing | #http://www.opengis.net/def/x-OGC/TBD/LivingThing#   | sml:LivingThing | The system consists of one or more animals or other living organisms (most often used with `systemType=Platform` when it carries sensors).
| Simulation   | #http://www.opengis.net/def/x-OGC/TBD/Simulation#    | sml:Simulation | The system is a software algorithm that simulates or predicts the state of the real-world (e.g. weather forecasts, mathematical models, training simulations, etc.).
| Process      | #http://www.opengis.net/def/x-OGC/TBD/Process#       | sml:Process | The system is a process or process chain that transforms data coming from or going to other systems.
| Group        | #http://www.opengis.net/def/x-OGC/TBD/Group#         | sml:Group | The system represents a group of similar systems (e.g. sensor network, vehicle fleet, etc.). Such system usually has subsystems that provide detailed information about each member in the group.
| Other        | #http://www.opengis.net/def/x-OGC/TBD/Other#         | sml:Other | Any other type of asset not accounted for in this list. In this case, an application specific property can be used to provide the type.
|====

NOTE: Deployments can be used to document how different types of systems are used together. For instance, a deployment may describe how a "human" (e.g. system of type platform) uses a piece of "equipment" (e.g. system of type sensor) according to a well defined procedure.

==== Location

It is recommended that the `System` resource representation includes the location of the system. If the implementation decides to report the location, it must be its latest known location.

include::../requirements/system/req_location.adoc[]

include::../requirements/system/req_location_time.adoc[]



=== System Canonical URL

The CS API Standard requires that every `System` resource has a canonical URL.

include::../requirements/system/req_canonical_url.adoc[]



[[clause-system-resources-endpoint]]
=== System Resources Endpoints

==== Definition

A `System` <<clause_api_endpoints,resources endpoint>> is an endpoint exposing a set of `System` resources that can be further filtered using query parameters.

include::../requirements/system/req_resources_endpoint.adoc[]

<<clause-systems-query-params>> defines additional query parameters applicable to `System` resources endpoint.

[[clause-canonical-system-rep]]
==== Canonical System Resources Endpoint

The CS API Standard requires that a canonical `System` resources endpoint, exposing all `System` resources, be made available by the server.

include::../requirements/system/req_canonical_endpoint.adoc[]



=== System Feature Collections

Any number of feature collections containing `System` features can be available at a CS API endpoint, but the server must at least expose one. Members of `System` feature collections are identified with the feature type `sosa:System`.

`System` resources can be grouped into collections according to any arbitrary criteria, as shown in the following examples.

[example%unnumbered]
====
*Examples of System Collections*

- All unmanned systems at URL `{api_root}/collections/uxs_systems`
- All UAV systems at URL `{api_root}/collections/uav_systems`
- All systems operated by organization X at URL `{api_root}/collections/orgx_systems`
- All currently deployed systems at URL `{api_root}/collections/deployed_systems`

_Note that a given system can be part of all 4 collections at the same time._
