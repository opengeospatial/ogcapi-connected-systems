== Requirements Class "System Events"
include::../requirements/systemevent/requirements_class_system_events.adoc[]

=== Overview

`SystemEvent` resources are used to capture information about various events and maintenance operations occuring on (observing) systems such as recalibrations, part replacements, software updates, relocations/deployments, operator handoffs, decommissioning, etc.

This section predefines a certain number of event types but the list can be extended further by extensions.



[[clause-systemevent-resource]]
=== SystemEvent Resource

`SystemEvent` resources are modeled on the SensorML Event class.

This section defines the attributes and associations composing a `SystemEvent` resource, but the exact way they are encoded in the payload is defined by each encoding. For encodings defined in this document, please see:

- <<clause-json-systemevents,System Event resource encoded in JSON>>

Below is the contextual class diagram of the `SystemEvent` resource:

==== Properties

The following tables describe the attributes and associations of a `SystemEvent` resource.

=== SystemEvent Canonical URL

The CS API Standard requires that every `SystemEvent` resource has a canonical URL.

include::../requirements/systemevent/req_canonical_url.adoc[]



[[clause-systemevent-resources-endpoint]]
=== SystemEvent Resources Endpoints

==== Definition

A `SystemEvent` {resources-endpoint} is an endpoint exposing a set of `SystemEvent` resources that can be further filtered using query parameters.

include::../requirements/systemevent/req_resources_endpoint.adoc[]

<<clause-systemevent-query-params>> defines additional query parameters applicable to `SystemEvent` resources endpoint.

[[clause-canonical-systemevent-rep]]
==== Canonical SystemEvent Resources Endpoint

The CS API Standard requires that a canonical `SystemEvent` resources endpoint, exposing all `SystemEvent` resources, be made available by the server.

include::../requirements/systemevent/req_canonical_endpoint.adoc[]

==== Nested SystemEvent Resources Endpoints

The set of events related to a specific system is available at a nested endpoint under the corresponding `System` resource:

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/system-event/ref-from-system

part:: The server SHALL implement a {systemevent-resources-endpoint} at path `{api_root}/systems/{sysId}/events` for each available `System` resource.

part:: The endpoint SHALL only expose the `SystemEvent` resources associated to the `System` with ID `sysId`.
====



=== SystemEvent Collections

Any number of resources collections containing `SystemEvent` resources can be available at a CS API endpoint. `SystemEvent` collections are identified with the item type `SystemEvent`.

`SystemEvent` resources can be grouped into collections according to any arbitrary criteria, as exemplified below:

[example%unnumbered]
====
*Examples of SystemEvent Collections*

- All events related to a fleet of UAVs at URL `{api_root}/collections/uas_fleet1_events`
- All events related to a particular mission at URL `{api_root}/collections/mission23_events`

_Note that a given event can be part of multiple collections at the same time._
