== Requirements Class "Create/Replace/Delete"

=== Overview
include::../requirements/crud/requirements_class_crd.adoc[]

The "Create/Replace/Delete" requirements class specifies how instances of the resource types defined in this Standard are created, replaced and deleted via a CS API endpoint.

All resources are created, replaced and deleted using CREATE (HTTP POST), REPLACE (HTTP PUT) and DELETE (HTTP DELETE) operations, respectively, as defined by the {ogcapi-features-4} Standard.

{ogcapi-features-4} uses the terms "resources endpoint" and "resource endpoint" to identify the paths where these operations are supported by the server. The following sections provide these endpoints for each resource type defined by the CS API Standard.



=== DataStreams

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/create-replace-delete/datastream

conditions:: The server implements <<clause-datastreams,style=basic%>>

part:: The server SHALL support the CREATE operation at the `DataStream` resources endpoints defined by the following URI template:
  - `{api_root}/systems/{sysId}/datastreams`

part:: The server SHALL support the REPLACE and DELETE operations at the `DataStream` resource endpoints defined by the following URI templates:
  - `{api_root}/systems/{sysId}/datastreams/{id}`
  - `{api_root}/datastreams/{id}`

part:: The `sysId` parameter is the local identifier of the `System` resource the `DataStream` is (or will be) associated to. +
       The `id` parameter is the local identifier of the `DataStream` resource to replace or delete.
====

The following constraints must be implemented by the server.

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/create-replace-delete/datastream-update-schema

conditions:: The server implements <<clause-datastreams,style=basic%>>

part:: The server SHALL reject a REPLACE request on a `DataStream` resource that modifies the observation schema if the `DataStream` already has nested `Observation` resources. The server SHALL use HTTP status code 409 to report the error.
====

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/create-replace-delete/datastream-delete-cascade

conditions:: The server implements <<clause-datastreams,style=basic%>>

part:: By default, the server SHALL reject a DELETE request on a `DataStream` resource that has nested `Observation` resources. The server SHALL use HTTP status code 409 to report the error.

part:: If the request contains the `cascade` parameter, the server SHALL accept the DELETE request and delete the `DataStream` resource as well as all its nested `Observation` resources.
====

NOTE: A schema must be provided before observations can be inserted in the datastream. The schema is provided along with the `DataStream` resource itself. Only one schema (for only one format) can be provided by a create operation for a given datastream. However, the server is allowed to automatically convert observations to/from other supported formats, as appropriate. This implies that the server can also automatically generate equivalent schemas for these other formats. Future extensions may define patterns to allow client to define multiple schemas themselves.

NOTE: After a datastream has been created and observations have been associated to it, the server may reject certain updates to the schema (e.g., adding or removing result fields, changing UoM, etc.). Datastream schema evolution will be addressed in more details in a future revision, but the current workaround is to create a new datastream if the schema changes.

[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/create-replace-delete/observation-schema

       The `id` parameter is the local identifier of the `ControlStream` resource to replace or delete.
====

The following constraints must be implemented by the server.

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/create-replace-delete/controlstream-update-schema

conditions:: The server implements <<clause-controlstreams,style=basic%>>

part:: The server SHALL reject a REPLACE request on a `ControlStream` resource that modifies the command schema if the `ControlStream` already has nested `Command` resources. The server SHALL use HTTP status code 409 to report the error.
====

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/create-replace-delete/controlstream-delete-cascade

conditions:: The server implements <<clause-controlstreams,style=basic%>>

part:: By default, the server SHALL reject a DELETE request on a `ControlStream` resource that has nested `Command` resources. The server SHALL use HTTP status code 409 to report the error.

part:: If the request contains the `cascade` parameter, the server SHALL accept the DELETE request and delete the `ControlStream` resource as well as all its nested `Command` resources.
====



=== Commands

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/create-replace-delete/command

conditions:: The server implements <<clause-controlstreams,style=basic%>>

part:: The server SHALL support the CREATE operation at the `Command` resources endpoints defined by the following URI template:
  - `{api_root}/controlstreams/{csId}/commands`

part:: The server SHALL support the REPLACE and DELETE operations at the `Command` resource endpoints defined by the following URI templates:
  - `{api_root}/controlstreams/{csId}/commands/{id}`
  - `{api_root}/commands/{id}`

part:: The `csId` parameter is the local identifier of the `ControlStream` resource the `Command` is (or will be) associated to. +
       The `id` parameter is the local identifier of the `Command` resource to replace or delete.
====

The following constraints must be implemented by the server.

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/create-replace-delete/command-schema

conditions:: The server implements <<clause-controlstreams,style=basic%>>

part:: The server SHALL reject a `Command` CREATE or REPLACE request with HTTP status code 400 if the `Command` representation is not valid with respect to the schema provided by the parent `ControlStream` resource.
====

NOTE: Cancelling a command is different from deleting the `Command` resource with an HTTP DELETE request. When a command is cancelled, the `Command` resource remain on the server but its status is changed to `CANCELED` (and of course the command processing should be aborted whenever possible). Command cancellation is implemented by posting a new status report with status code `CANCELED` at the command status endpoint. See requirements for `CommandStatus` resources endpoints below.
