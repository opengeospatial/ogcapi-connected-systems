[[clause-encoding-swebinary]]
=== Requirements Class "SWE Common Binary Encoding"
include::../requirements/encoding/swebinary/requirements_class_swebinary.adoc[]


==== Overview

This requirements class defines binary encodings of `Observation` and `Command` resources based on the Binary Encoding defined in the <<OGC-SWECOMMON,SWE Common 3.0>> Standard.

The main objective of this encoding is better data size efficiency than text or JSON, thus allowing for:

- Transfer of observations and commands over very low power / low bandwidth network links (e.g., LoRa,  etc.); and
- Transfer high bandwidth data sets such as raster data (e.g., video, LiDAR, etc.).

For even better efficiency, this encoding can be combined with a transport protocol such as <<clause-protocol-mqtt,MQTT>>.


==== Media Type

NOTE: Implementations should use *`application/vnd.ogc.swe+binary`* as a preliminary media type until the <<OGC-SWECOMMON,SWE Common 3.0>> Standard is stable to avoid confusing future implementations accessing JSON documents from draft versions of the Standard. The media type `{swe-binary-mediatype}` will be registered for SWE Common binary encoding, if and once this Standard is approved by the OGC Members. This note will be removed before publishing this Standard.

The media type used when using the SWE Common Text encoding is *`{swe-binary-mediatype}`*.
