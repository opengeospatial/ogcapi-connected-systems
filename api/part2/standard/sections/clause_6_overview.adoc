== Overview
=== General

All resources defined in Part 1 of this Standard are feature resources, among which the `System` resource. Part 2 (this document) defines additional resource types to describe and interact with the dynamic data that flows in and out of these systems.

Part 2 of this Standard defines resource types that allow the provision of dynamic data about all kinds of devices, hardware components or processes that can transmit and/or receive data via communication networks (a.k.a. connected systems), including sensors, platforms, robots, human observers, forecast models, computer simulations, etc.

Flows carrying observation and status data coming out of a system are called `Datastreams` while flows carrying commands sent to a system are called `Control Streams` (note that the direction of the flow mentioned here is relative to the real system, which is different from the direction of the data flows going in and out of the API server). 



=== Design Considerations

In this Standard, `Observations` and `Commands` are purposefully not modelled as `Features`. This choice was made to keep a clear separation between the `Features of Interest` that represent concrete or virtual objects (or things) of interest (and in the vast majority of use cases, real-world objects) and the other concepts that are used to encapsulate dynamic data related to these features:

- `Observations` carry the result of the estimation of one or more feature properties, at a given time (and location); and

- `Commands` carry the desired value of one or more feature properties, at a given time.


Likewise, `DataStreams` and `ControlStreams` are not modelled as features, as they are simply containers for `Observations` and `Commands`, respectively. More specifically, they are particular cases of homogeneous collections that are associated to a single `System` (see <<clause-datastreams;and!clause-controlstreams>>).



=== Resource Types

As indicated above, while part 1 of this Standard focused on defining "static" feature types, part 2 defines additional resources to deal with dynamic data associated to these features.

<<api-class-diagram>> shows a UML class diagram of all Connected Systems API resources. Resources defined in part 2 are shown with a solid border while resources that were already defined in part 1 are shown with a dashed light gray outline.

=== API Endpoints

{ogcapi-cs-1} defines the concept of canonical *resources endpoint* and *canonical resource endpoint*. This section provides the canonical endpoints used in CS API Part 2.

==== Canonical Resources Endpoints

The canonical resources endpoints for resource types defined in Part 2 of the CS API Standard are:

- `{api_root}/datastreams`
- `{api_root}/observations`
- `{api_root}/controlstreams`
- `{api_root}/commands`
- `{api_root}/feasibility`
- `{api_root}/systemEvents`

==== Canonical Resource Endpoints

The canonical URL templates to access a single resource defined in Part 2 of the CS API Standard are:

- `{api_root}/datastreams/{id}`
- `{api_root}/observations/{id}`
- `{api_root}/controlstreams/{id}`
- `{api_root}/commands/{id}`
- `{api_root}/feasibility/{id}`
- `{api_root}/systemEvents/{id}`
