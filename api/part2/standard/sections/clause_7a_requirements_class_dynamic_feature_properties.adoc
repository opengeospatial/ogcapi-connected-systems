=== Overview

Dynamic feature properties are feature properties whose values change over time.


=== Dynamic Tag

This requirements class defines a tag to be used in any JSON representation to identify properties that are dynamic (i.e., time varying).

This is done by adding the `@dynamic` suffix to any JSON member name and setting the value to true.


=== Feature Snapshot

This requirements class also defines a behavior of a server when using the existing `datetime` property in a request.

For dynamic features, when the `datetime` query parameter is used to specify a time instant, (and the `snapshot` parameter is set to true?), the server must take a snapshot of the feature properties at the specified time.

This can be used in conjunction with the `temporalProperties` sub resource provided by OGC API - Moving Features.
