==== DerivedProperty Class

The `DerivedProperty` class is used to define domain specific properties that are derived from general properties such as the ones provided by the QUDT Quantity Kinds ontology.

The UML diagram of the `DerivedProperty` class is shown on <<derived-prop-class-diagram>> and <<derived-prop-class-properties>> provides the description of the class properties:
