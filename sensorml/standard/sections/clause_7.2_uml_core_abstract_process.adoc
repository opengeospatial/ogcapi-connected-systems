=== Requirements Class: Core Abstract Process
include::../requirements/model/coreProcess/requirements_class.adoc[]

All major classes in SensorML are based on a process model, as presented in the core concepts. Processes are features as defined in ISO 19109:2006 and modeled in GML 3.2. SensorML also supports interoperable discovery, identification, and qualification of these processes through the definition of a standard collection of metadata.

==== ObservableProperty
An ObservableProperty is a physical property of a phenomenon that can be observed and measured (e.g., temperature, gravitational force, position, chemical concentration, orientation, number-of-individuals, physical switch status, etc.), or a characteristic of one or more feature types, the value for which must be estimated by application of some procedure in an observation. It is thus a physical stimulus that can be sensed by a detector or created by an actuator.

[example%unnumbered]
====
*Examples*

The ObservableProperty element allows one to reference a measurable property of a phenomenon or feature for detector inputs or actuator outputs. For example, the temperature of the atmosphere is an ObservableProperty. Before measurement, it is simply a property of the atmosphere that can be defined and measured. After measurement by a detector, the temperature may be represented as a Quantity with units of measure, a value, and an indication of our degree of confidence in the measurement.
====

ObservableProperty is derived as a concrete instance of the SWE Common AbstractSWEIdentifiable and adds the definition property to this model. It will be used as a potential input (e.g., for detectors), output (e.g., for actuators), and for parameters (e.g., for a sensor whose measurement varies with fluctuations of atmospheric pressure on a diaphragm).

In ObservableProperty the phenomenon property will be defined by reference using the definition attribute. The definition attribute value will reference a property defined within a dictionary or ontology. An ObservableProperty may also include a name and a description. However, unlike the simple data types in SWE Common, an ObservableProperty does NOT include the properties uom, quality, or constraints, since these are typically characteristics of the measuring procedure and not properties of the observable phenomenon itself.

[[uml_described_object]]
==== DescribedObject
As shown in the UML model below, the DescribedObject class provides a specific set of metadata for all process classes in SensorML. Since DescribedObject is itself derived from GML AbstractFeature, all processes in SensorML are themselves features, which conforms to the conceptual models for processes as stated in Section 6.

include::../requirements/model/coreProcess/requirement3.adoc[]

The GML AbstractFeature inheritance provides a unique ID, and support for multiple names and a description. The unique ID in SensorML will be supported by a single gml:identifier property inherited from GML AbstractFeature.

include::../requirements/model/coreProcess/requirement4.adoc[]

Metadata about each process is essential to supporting identification, discovery, and qualification of the process. Metadata is provided by the base class, DescribedObject, from which AbstractProcess is derived. While these metadata may provide relevant information to understand quality of output from the process, the values of properties within the DescribedObject should not be required for execution of the process. The model for the DescribedObject is shown in Figure 9, while the models for the individual property values are provided in either Figure 10 or in the ISO 19115 models in Figure 11.

The DescribedObject includes several descriptive properties that support rapid discovery (keywords, identification, and classification), constraints (validTime, securityConstraints, legalConstraints), qualification (characteristics and capabilities), references (contacts and documentation), and history. These are each grouped in lists, which provide for easy seaparation and parsing of these properties.

===== Extension Property
The extension property allows one to add domain or community-specific content to a DescribedObject instance. This might include, for example, security taggings, vendor or community-specific metadata, or information encoded in other models or schema. Extension properties must exist in a separate namespace and SensorML-compliant software is not required to understand or utilize the information contained within the extension property.

The constraints on the extension property include: (a) the extension model must be defined in a separate namespace, (b) the information added by the extension model must not be required for execution of the process, and (c) SensorML-compliant parsers may parse and utilize the information within these extensions but they are not required to do so in order to be compliant to the SensorML standard.

.Models for Metadata Elements

===== Keywords
Keywords provide a simple means of discovery using short tokens that may be recognized by the general audience or specific communities. Keywords are unqualified terms in that they are not necessarily required to be related to a specific codespace or ontology, as are classifiers and identifiers.

===== Identifiers
The identifier property takes a Term as its value. The Term has a definition attribute that specifies in this case the type of identifier, while the codeSpace attribute specifies that the value of the identifier is according to the rules or enumerations of a particular authority.

[example%unnumbered]
====
*Examples*

An identifier with a definition of “http://sensors.ws/def/tailNumber” might take “N291PV” as its value based on the codespace of a US Air Force rules dictionary. Other possible definitions for identifiers might include, for example, shortName, longName, acronym, missionID, processorID, serialNumber, manufacturerID, or partNumber.
==== 

The identification properties should be considered as information suitable for the discovery applications. 

===== Classifiers
The classifier property provides a list of possible classifiers that might aid in the rapid discovery or organization of processes, sensors, or sensor systems. The classifier properties should be considered as information suitable for the discovery and categorization applications.

[example%unnumbered]
====
*Examples*

Definitions for a classifier Term might include, for instance, sensorType, observableType, processType, intendedApplication, or missionType. 
====

===== Security Constraints
The model for specification of security constraints shall be based on external security models, such as the Security Banner Marking model of the Intelligence Community Information Security Marking (IC ISM) Standard. The securityConstraints property takes a value of xs:Any which allows various communities and countries to utilize their standard XML encoding for security tags. This security constraint is for the overall document. As will be discussed in the XML encoding, extension points provided with SWE Common Data elements will allow security tagging for individual properties or property aggregates.

[example%unnumbered]
====
*Examples*

One can specify the overall security classification of the entire document using the Intelligence Community Information Security Banner Marking (IC ISM) standard or using ISO 19115 MD_Constraints. For tagging individual sections in the document, the SensorML standard allows for security tagging of properties using an extension property, as describe in later sections of the standard.
====

===== Valid Time Constraint
The validTime property indicates the time instance or time range over which this process description is valid. Time constraints are important for processes in which parameter values or operation modes may change with time, or instrument deployment times change.

[example%unnumbered]
====
*Examples*

Several SensorML documents can exist for the same sensor or system description but with different validity periods. This allows for capturing the configuration of a sensor at different times and, along with the history section, is the basis for maintaining history of the sensor’s description. Alternately, parameter values can be provided as a time-tagged series of values accounting for changes.
====

==== Legal Constraint

The legalConstraints property is based on ISO 19115 and specifies whether such legal and ethical considerations as privacy acts, intellectual property rights, copyrights, or scientific publication ethics apply to the content of the process description and its use.

==== Capabilities

The capabilities property is intended for the definition of properties that further qualify the input or output of the process, component, or system for the purpose of discovery. These properties are defined using one or more SWE Common DataRecord elements.

Once a user has identified candidate sensors or processes based on the classifiers described above, the capabilities parameters might prove useful for further filtering of processes or sensor system during this discovery stage. Thus, the capabilities properties should be considered as information suitable for the discovery process.

[example%unnumbered]
====
*Examples*

A particular remote sensor on a satellite might measure radiation between a certain spectral range (e.g., 700 to 900 nanometers) at a particular ground resolution (e.g., 5 meter), and with a typical spatial repeat period (e.g., 3.25 – 4.3 days). Alternatively, a particular process might have certain quality constraints. Any process may have certain limits (e.g., operational and survivable limits), based on physical or mathematical conditions. These properties do affect the output of the process and should be considered as capabilities.
====

==== Characteristics

A physical or non-physical process may have characteristics that may not directly qualify the output. These properties are defined using one or more SWE Common DataRecord elements.

[example%unnumbered]
====
*Examples*

A component may have certain physical measurements such as dimensions and weight and be constructed of a particular material. A component may have particular power demands, or anticipated lifetime. These are characteristics of the component that may not directly affect the output of the component or system.
====

The characteristics properties may or may not be considered as information suitable for the discovery process.

==== Contacts

Contact information can provide access to manufacturers, system experts, equipment owners, or any other persons responsible in some way for design, deployment, maintenance, or additional information regarding the DescribedObject. The contact property within the ContactList takes the ISO 19115 classes CI_ResponsibleParty as its values.

==== Documentation

Documentation can be provided which provides further clarification about the DescribedObject. This might include technical manuals, manufacturer brochures, journal references, or theoretical-basis documents. The DocumentList document property takes the ISO 19115 CI_OnlineResource as its value.

==== History

Within SensorML, the history of a process can be provided through a collection of Event objects. These are provided within an EventList that serves as the value of the history property. Events might for instance, specify calibration or maintenance history of a sensor, changes to an algorithm or parameter within a computational process, or deployment and maintenance events.

[[uml_abstract_process]]
==== AbstractProcess
As discussed in the Core Concepts, the major elements of SensorML are modeled as physical and non-physical processes. All SensorML process elements shall derive from AbstractProcess,shown in <<abstract_process_uml>>. The class AbstractProcess itself derives from the DescribedObject class and thus inherits a wide range of optional metadata supporting discovery, identification, and qualification and an option for domain and community-specific extensions. In addition to the metadata provided by DescribedObject, the AbstractProcess includes the properties of inputs, outputs, and parameters, as required by the process model defined in the Core Concepts, as well as the properties typeOf, featureOfInterest, configuration, and modes which will be discussed below. 

[[abstract_process_uml]]
.UML models for DescribedObject and AbstractProcess
image::figures/abstract_process_uml.png[]

===== Inputs, Outputs, and Parameters

As discussed in the Core Concepts, any process can have inputs, outputs, and parameters. Processes typically receive input and based on the parameter settings and methodology, generate output. Some processes, such as detectors, receive physical stimulus as input and generate digital numbers as output. In such cases, the input would be represented as an ObservableProperty, and the output as a DataComponent (e.g., a Quantity). If this output is encoded and accessible directly, then the output can be represented as a DataInterface.

[example%unnumbered]
====
*Examples*

A digital thermometer is stimulated by an observable property of the environment (temperature), which is modelled as its input (ObservableProperty), and outputs a digital number (Quantity) that represents a measure of that property.
====

Thus, an AbstractProcess model supports the inputs, outputs, and parameters properties in conformance with the Core Concepts. These properties can accept ObservableProperty or SWE Common elements AbstractDataComponent or DataStream as their values. Classes derived from AbstractDataComponent include Quantity, Count, Category, Boolean, Text, and Time, as well as ranges and aggregates of these simple data types.

.UML models for process inputs, outputs, and parameters
image::figures/process_iops_uml.png[]

The core process model will utilize the SWE Common Data Models for defining inputs, outputs, and parameters, as well as for other metadata properties. SensorML models are required to support the SWE Common Data Model up to the Block Components Requirements Class, but many instances of SensorML will find ALL conformance levels of SWE Common Data to be useful, including binary encodings.

include::../requirements/model/coreProcess/requirement7.adoc[]

The input, output, or parameters of many processes include multiple values, possibly of different data types, that are tightly related to one another. Sometimes referred to as tuples or records, these data aggregates can consist of values that are perhaps meaningless without the other associated values (e.g., the coordinates within a spatial reference system), or provide a more complete understanding because of their association with one another (e.g., a set of measured values taken by a sensor at a given time). Such data shall be modelled using the aggregate data types defined by the SWE Common Data standard.

[example%unnumbered]
====
*Examples*

The location of a dynamic object can be specified through the aggregate values of time, latitude, longitude, and altitude. In such cases, the expression of one of the values separate from the others is meaningless or less complete than the expression of these values as a set or aggregate. These four values should be encapsulated in a Vector data type that also identifies the reference frame in which the latitude, longitude and altitude coordinates are expressed  

Weather stations often express a set of measurements of the atmosphere as a single record that might include for instance temperature, pressure, relative humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, and wind direction. These would be considered a tuple of values that provides a more complete picture of the environment at a particular time. This tuple should be modeled as a DataRecord with 7 fields (one for each measured parameters listed above + one time stamp) to indicate that the sampling time applies to all observable values included in the record. 
====

include::../requirements/model/coreProcess/requirement8.adoc[]

===== Feature of Interest

Most sensors and many non-physical processes have been deployed or implemented with a focus on one or more features of interest. Within SensorML, the primary purpose of including a FeatureOfInterest property for AbstractProcess is to support discovery as well as to further clarify the intended purpose of the physical or non-physical process.

[example%unnumbered]
====
*Examples*

The features of interest of an installed web camera might include a particular building, a particular street, or a general area of observation surrounding the camera. Features of interest for other sensors might include the Gulf of Mexico, a particular drilling well, the atmosphere surrounding a particular weather station, a particular patient, or a particular automobile. Features of interest for a model or other process might include a particular river basin, a particular toxic plume release, or a particular metropolitan area. 
====

 
===== Inheritance, Extension, and Configuration

SensorML supports the concepts of inheritance, extension, and configuration. In other words, generalized base processes can be described in SensorML and then that description can be augmented or further constrained by one or more separate descriptions. Thus, a single, generalized description of a physical or non-physical process can serve as a basis for one or many more specific process descriptions. This provides support for more simple and concise process descriptions while also providing the ability for the user or application to “drill down” to greater and greater detail as desired.

The inheritance model will support two cases:

* Simple inheritance – the specific process description provides only additional information to the description of the general process, without modifying or restricting any property values of the general process.
* Configuration – the specific process description is able to set or restrict property values within the allowable range provided by the general process description, as well as provide additional information.

The key to inheritance, extension, and configuration of a process lies in the typeOf property, by which a specific process can reference its more general base process. The typeOf property takes as its value any process model derived from AbstractProcess. This will be “by-reference-only” meaning that the value must be in the form of a resolvable link to another process instance.

include::../requirements/model/coreProcess/requirement9.adoc[]

====== Simple Inheritance
In the simple inheritance model, a process (referred to as the “specific process”) inherits and augments information from another process (referred to as the “general process”).

[example%unnumbered]
====
*Examples*

An Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) provides a description of a particular model of their sensor that would define inputs, outputs, and parameters, as well as perhaps capabilities, characteristics, manufacturer contact information and documentation relevant to that model. Thousands of sensors of this model type may of course be manufactured and sold by the OEM.  When one purchases and deploys an instance of that model of sensor, the owner can then reference the OEM’s description of the model and provide additional information that’s specific to his specific instance of the sensor. Additional information might include, for example, serial number, owner’s contact information, the sensor’s location, calibration data, and the interface description for accessing the data.  
====

The simple inheritance model is fully supported in the Core Process conformance class and will be supported solely through the use of the typeOf property within the specific process. The typeOf property within the specific process will reference the general process through a resolvable reference.

include::../requirements/model/coreProcess/requirement10.adoc[]

====== Support for Configurable Processes
A configurable process is one that includes options or choices that can be selected, restricted, or enabled during deployment, operation, or execution of that process.

[example%unnumbered]
====
*Examples*

An Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) can provide a description of a particular model of their sensor that would define inputs, outputs, and parameters, as well as perhaps capabilities, characteristics, manufacturer contact information and documentation relevant to that model. In addition, the OEM enables an individual instance of that model of sensor to be configured by providing options for setting parameter values, setting modes, or choosing a particular interface. Thousands of sensors of this model type may of course be manufactured and sold by the OEM.  

When one purchases and deploys an instance of that model of sensor, the owner can then reference the OEM’s description of the model and provide additional information that’s specific to that particular instance of the sensor. In addition, the owner can configure the sensor by setting values, selecting modes, and enabling particular interfaces. These settings would be provided in the instance description.
====  

The configuration model will utilize both the typeOf and configuration properties. The typeOf property references the more general process as with simple inheritance, while the configuration property provides a means to further restrict the options and allowed values for the specific process. The configuration property in the AbstractProcess takes an AbstractSettings class as its value.

include::../requirements/model/coreProcess/requirement11.adoc[]

A concrete implementation of a Settings class will be provided in a later Conformance Clause.

==== SWE Common Data Types
Many properties in the DescribedObject and AbstractProcess classes described above are of type AbstractDataComponent as defined in the SWE Common Data Model standard. This data type is used for defining inputs, outputs and parameters, as well as for other metadata properties.

This requirements class only mandates the support of the “Simple Components” and “Record Components” as defined in the SWE Common Data Model standard. These includes the scalar data types Boolean, Text, Count, Quantity, Category, Time and their range equivalents, as well as DataRecord and Vector.

include::../requirements/model/coreProcess/requirement12.adoc[]

However, many implementations of SensorML will find ALL conformance levels of the SWE Common Data Model to be useful, including arrays, choices and encodings. An implementation claiming support for more than the record components can pass the “Processes with Advanced Data Types” conformance test class of this standard.
