=== Requirements Class: Physical System
include::../requirements/model/physicalSystem/requirements_class.adoc[]

A physical system is used to model a hardware device as an aggregate process made of one or more components and whose location in the real world is known and of importance.

Sensor and actuator systems (e.g., machines and robots) are typically physical systems that perform a particular feat through the coordinated actions of both physical and non-physical sub-processes. Even though a sensor system’s overall application is to sense something in the environment, the system itself can consist of sensing components (e.g., detectors and sensing subsystems), action (e.g., actuators and robotic subsystems), and computational components.

*Examples*

A weather station is an example of physical system that is composed of several sensors (thermometer, barometer, wind sensor, etc.) and other computational process such as an algorithm to compute wind chill. All these components can be described in SensorML and grouped in a PhysicalComponent description representing the station as a whole. 

A hand-held digital camera can also be modeled as a physical system with an overall task of sensing radiance in a scene and generating an image. However, the camera is an aggregate of various sub-processes, each of which can be physical or non-physical, and can be sensing, acting, or computational. For example, a light detector outputs a measure of brightness, which serves as the input of a computational process which outputs a signal that provides input into an actuator that controls the opening or closing of the iris. The final iris size is sensed by another detector which inputs that value into a process that encodes that value into an EXIF format that accompanies the image, which is generated by a entirely different subsystem of the camera.

The model for PhysicalSystem, as shown in <<physical_system_model>>, is derived from AbstractPhysicalProcess, and adds the components and connections properties that have been described in the non-physical counterpart, <<uml_aggregate_process>>.
