=== Requirements Class: Configurable Processes
include::../requirements/model/configurableProcess/requirements_class.adoc[]

Many processes, both physical and non-physical, are configurable in that they provide one with the ability to set parameters values, enable options, or select modes before or during execution/operation. Thus a general configurable process can be defined and published specifying allowed values for parameters, modes that can be selected, and options that can be enabled or disabled.

A specific process that inherits from this general process can then refine the process in several ways by: (1) specifying values for parameters, (2) further constraining the allowable values of parameters, (3) selecting an operational mode (which then sets a group of parameter values), or (4) enabling or disabling particular options such as particular outputs or components.

In this document, we will refer to the more general process as the “configurable process”, and the more specific process that inherits from it, as the “configured process”.

include::../requirements/model/configurableProcess/requirement1.adoc[]
include::../requirements/model/configurableProcess/requirement2.adoc[]

A process shall be considered “configurable” if it provides options, variable parameters, or modes that can be selected or set before or during deployment or execution.

====
Example:

A configurable process based on the linear equation (y=mx+b) defines two parameters for “slope” and “y-intercept” but does not provide values for these parameters. A configured process can inherit from this configurable process and set the values of those parameters (e.g., y=2x+4).
====

A process becomes “configurable” by one or more of the following characteristics:

* it defines parameters, but not defining their values
* it defines a range or selection of possible values for parameters using the swe:AllowedValues property
* it defines modes which in turn set a collection of parameter values when enabled
* it allows inputs, outputs, or components to be enabled or disabled

A process becomes “configured” by having both of the following two characteristics:

* it inherits from a configurable process using the typeOf property
* it specifies one or more settings within the configuration property

==== Modes

====
Example:

A Doppler radar for monitoring storms may have several modes from which one can select depending on the prevailing conditions at the time. For instance, there can be “clear-sky”, “storm”, and “severe-storm” modes in which the scanning properties, radar intensity, and gain settings can all change by simply changing the mode setting
==== 

A configurable process can but is not required to contain one or more modes properties. The modes property takes an AbstractModes as its value. As shown in <<modes>>, the concrete ModeChoice class defined in this conformance clause is derived from AbstractModes and serves as the concrete instantiation for defining modes in this specification.

ModeChoice shall include two or more mode properties that take Mode as their value. In addition to metadata provided by the base DescribedObject class, Mode includes a configuration property that allows one to define a collection of settings for that mode.

The configuration property takes a Settings object, which will be described in more detail below.
==== Settings

The configuration property and it Settings value can be utilized in two cases:

* within the Mode definition of a configurable process for defining a collection of settings for that particular mode

* as a required property within a configured process for setting one or more configurable properties

include::../requirements/model/configurableProcess/requirement4.adoc[]

The Settings class is shown in <<modes>> with its possible property values shown in <<configured_process_settings>>. For all settings, the property in the configurable process is specified by the DataComponentPath reference. 

Within the Settings class, one may (a) set particular values for parameters, (b) set an array of values for a parameter (and only a parameter that takes a DataArray as its value, (c) further constrain allowed values for parameters, (d) set the operational mode, and (e) enable or disable an input or output.
