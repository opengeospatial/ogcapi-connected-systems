==== Deployment Class

The `Deployment` class is used to describe when, where, why and how physical or non-physical systems are being deployed. The class `Deployment` itself derives from the `DescribedObject` class and thus inherits a wide range of optional metadata supporting discovery, identification, and qualification and an option for domain and community-specific extensions.

In particular, the deployment metadata allows for the provision of:

- Contact information (e.g. the organization operating/maintaining the deployed systems, the pilot of an unmanned vehicle, etc.)
- Domain specific identifiers and classifiers for the deployment (e.g. mission number, mission type, etc.)
- Characteristics of the deployment (e.g. sensor is mounted under shelter at 2m above ground)

The UML diagram of the `Deployment` class is shown on <<deployment-class-diagram>> and <<deployment-class-properties>> provides the description of the class properties:

| *Name*           | *Definition*
| `location`       | The geographic location or area where the systems are deployed.
| `platform`       | Reference to the platform on which the systems are deployed.
| `deployedSystem` | Description of a deployed system (as a `DeployedSystem` object, see below).

==== DeployedSystem Class

The `DeployedSystem` class is used to describe each system deployed as part of a deployment. It includes the following properties:

|====
| *Name*           | *Definition*
| `name`           | A code name for the system within the deployment (e.g. UAV1).
| `description`    | A description of the deployed system that is specific to the deployment.

| `configuration`  | The configuration of the system used during this deployment.
