For text components (i.e., “Category”, “Text” or “Time” with ISO-8601 encoding), verify that the data type is one of the string types.

For scalar numerical components (i.e., “Quantity”, “Count” or “Time” with a simple unit), verify that:

- The data type is also numerical (i.e., one of the integer or floating point types)
- The range of values it allows can cover all possible numbers within the allowed intervals and enumerated values (e.g., A short data type cannot be used for an interval constraint of [-100000; 10000]). When no interval constraint is specified, this test should be ignored.
- The data type can accommodate the desired precision indicated by the “significantFigures” constraint (e.g., a float cannot be used for a number of significant figures greater than 7). When no precision constraint is specified, this test should be ignored.

For a boolean component, verify that the data type is an unsigned byte (http://www.opengis.net/def/dataType/OGC/0/unsignedByte).
