test-purpose:: Verify that the implementation of block component classes have a constraint that enforces the requirement.

test-method::
- Inspect the model or software implementation.
- Check that the “DataArray”, “Matrix” and “DataStream” classes have the constraint.
- Inspect instances of these classes generated by the implementation to verify that an encoding method is specified whenever there are encoded values present.
