=== Requirements Class: Binary Encoding Rules

include::../requirements/encoding_rules/binary/requirements_class.adoc[]

The “BinaryEncoding” method encodes field values by their binary representation. The ABNF syntax defined in IETF RFC 5234 is used to formalize the encoding rules, and thus all ABNF snippets provided in this section are normative.

include::../requirements/encoding_rules/binary/requirement1.adoc[]

The encoding rules are similar to those of the “TextEncoding” method except that numerical values are encoded directly as their binary representation and that no separators are used. Separators are not needed because data types have either a fixed size or contain length information (See String encoding).


==== Rules for Scalar Components

The value for a scalar component is encoded as its binary representation. This especially applies to numerical values that are encoded directly in binary form in accordance to the selected data type and the value of the “byteOrder” attribute.

[source%unnumbered]
----
scalar-value = < binary value encoded according to data type, byte encoding and byte order specifications >
----

The last column of <<binary-datatypes-table>> indicates how each data type shall be binary encoded into a low level byte sequence. The actual order of bytes composing a multi-bytes data type depends on the value of the “byteOrder” attribute. The ‘bigEndian’ option indicates that muti-bytes data types are encoded with the most significant byte (MSB) first, while selecting ‘littleEndian’ signifies that encoding is done with the less significant byte (LSB) first. A UTF-8 string is not considered as a multi-byte data type and is always encoded in the same order, as specified by the Unicode Standard.

include::../requirements/encoding_rules/binary/requirement2.adoc[]

Nil values are included in the stream just like normal scalar values. Since their data type has to match the field data type, there is no special treatment necessary for a decoder or encoder. It is the responsibility of the application to match the data value against the list of registered nil values for a given field in order to detect if it is associated to a nil reason or if it is an actual measurement value.

When the ‘raw’ byte encoding option is selected, bytes resulting from the data type encoding process defined above are inserted in the binary stream directly. This is refered to as ‘raw binary’ encoding. When the ‘base64’ option is selected, each byte resulting from the binary encoding process is also encoded in Base64 before being included in the stream. Scalar values can be Base 64 encoded one by one or by blocks as long as the resulting stream is compatible with requirements of IETF RFC 2045.

==== Rules for Range Components

Range components are encoded as a sequence of two binary values (each one representing a scalar value):

[source%unnumbered]
----
min-value = scalar-value

max-value = scalar-value

range-values = min-value max-value
----

Values are always included in the same order: The lower bound of the range first, followed by the upper bound.


==== Rules for DataRecord and Vector

Values of fields of a “DataRecord” are recursively encoded following rules associated to the type of component used as the field’s description (i.e., scalar, record, array, etc.) and appended to the binary block:

[source%unnumbered]
----
field-count = < Number of fields in the record. Greater or equal to 1 >

any-field-value = scalar-value / range-values / record-values / choice-values / array-values / block_values

mandatory-field-value = any-field-value

optional-field-value = (“Y” any-field-value) / “N”

field-value = mandatory-field-value / optional-field-value

record-values = <field-count>*field-values
----

When a field is marked as optional in the definition, the 1-byte value ‘Y’ (ASCII code 89) or ‘N’ (ASCII code 78) shall be inserted in the data block. When the field value is omitted, the token ‘N’ is inserted alone. When it is included, the token ‘Y’ is inserted followed by the actual field value.

include::../requirements/encoding_rules/binary/requirement4.adoc[]

Coordinate values of “Vector” components are encoded with a similar syntax, but a coordinate value can only be scalar and cannot be omitted:

[source%unnumbered]
----
coord-count = < Number of coordinates in the vector. Greater or equal to 1 >

vector-values = <coord-count>*scalar-value
----

Vector coordinates cannot be optional.


==== Rules for DataChoice

A “DataChoice” is encoded with the binary method by providing the zero-based index of the selected item before the item values themselves. The index value ranges from 0 for the first choice item to `(number_of_items - 1)` for the last item.

[source%unnumbered]
----
selected-item-idx = < Index of the item selected >

selected-item-value = scalar-value / range-values / record-values / choice-values / array-values

choice-values = selected-item-idx selected-item-value
----

include::../requirements/encoding_rules/binary/requirement5.adoc[]


==== Rules for DataArray and Matrix

Values of each “DataArray” or “Matrix” element are recursively encoded following rules associated to the type of component used for the element type (i.e., scalar, record, array, etc.). Groups of values (or single value in the case of a scalar element type) corresponding to each element are sequentially appended to the data block. Since a “DataArray” or “Matrix” can have a fixed or variable size, two slightly different syntaxes for encoding values are possible:

[source%unnumbered]
----
array-values = fixed-size-array-values / variable-size-array-values

element-value = scalar-value / range-values / record-values / choice-values / array-values / block_values
----

Fixed size arrays have a size of at least one, and are encoded as defined below:

[source%unnumbered]
----
fixed-element-count = < Number of elements in a fixed size array > 

fixed-size-array-values = <fixed-element-count>*element-value
----

When a “DataArray” (“Matrix”) is defined as variable size, its size can be 0 and the array size is included as a token in the data block, before the actual array elements values are listed:

[source%unnumbered]
----
variable-element-count = < Number of elements in a variable size array >

variable-size-array-values = variable-element-count <variable-element-count>*element-value
----

When the array size is 0, only this number is encoded and no element values are included in the data block.


==== Rules for DataStream

Values of “DataStream” elements are encoded exactly as elements of an array: 

[source%unnumbered]
----
stream-element-count = < Number of elements in a data stream >

stream-values = <stream-element-count>*element-value
----

A data stream usually contains at least one value but could be empty.


==== Rules for Geometry

The value of “Geometry” is encoded using the WKB format defined in the Simple Feature Access Standard (<<OGC_SFA>>).

include::../requirements/encoding_rules/binary/requirement6.adoc[]

No specific marker or length information needs to be pre-pended to the binary representation since the WKB format is self descriptive and parsable without knowing the total length ahead of time.


==== Block encoded components

When block encoding characteristics are also specified in the encoding description, the encryption and/or compression algorithm shall be applied after the binary encoding process described above is completed for the block. Extensions of this standard can define compression and encryption methods that fit the needs of particular communities.

In order to maximize compatibility with existing software, when compressing a binary encoded data stream results in a well known binary format, the corresponding mime type can be used instead of application/octet-stream. For instance video/h264 can be used when the entirety of the dataset (presumably a video stream) is compressed using the H264 video codec.


==== Media Types

When array or stream values are encoded with the Binary encoding method and provided standalone (i.e., outside of any wrapper format), one of the following media type identifiers shall be used:

1. One of *`application/octet-stream`* or *`application/vnd.ogc.swe+binary`* shall be used as the content-type for files and HTTP responses.

2. *`application/vnd.ogc.swe+binary`* shall be used for format negotiation between server and client (e.g., when the format is advertised by an API or web service). In particular, this media type shall be used in HTTP `Accept` and `Link` headers and in any server response used to advertise support or link to a resource encoded with this format.
