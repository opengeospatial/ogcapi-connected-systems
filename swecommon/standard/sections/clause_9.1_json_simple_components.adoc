=== Requirements Class: Basic Types and Simple Components JSON Schemas

include::../requirements/json/simple_components/requirements_class.adoc[]

Validation patterns that implement all classes defined respectively in the “Basic Types” and “Simple Components” UML packages are provided as JSON schema files at {jsonschema-base-url}.

The entry point schema used for validation is {jsonschema-base-url}/sweCommon.json[“sweCommon.json”].

include::../requirements/json/simple_components/requirement2.adoc[]


==== General JSON Principles

The following rules were used when generating the JSON schemas:

- Classes are implemented as JSON Objects;

- Any property with a multiplicity greater than one is implemented as a JSON Array and its name is converted to plural form;

- Textual fields are implemented as a JSON String;

- Decimal fields are implemented as a union of JSON Number and JSON String value types (the string value allowing for special values, see <<json_special_numerical_values>>); and

- ISO8601 date/time fields are implemented as a JSON String with a union of date/time formats.


[[json_special_numerical_values]]
==== Special Numerical Values

JSON does not define special decimal values for 'Not a Number', positive infinity and negative infinity. It is thus necessary to encode them as strings.

include::../requirements/json/simple_components/requirement3.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
These special value strings have been chosen because they are supported natively by Javascript/ECMA Script implementations. The `+` unary operator can be used to transparently parse one of these strings to a Number type (see https://262.ecma-international.org/13.0/#sec-unary-plus-operator).

These values also correspond to infinities and NaN values defined in <<IEEE754>>.

// ===== IDs and Linkable Properties

// Links are represented by a link object that is modeled on the <<WebLinking>> standard.

==== Abstract Base Classes

The three abstract base classes defined in the UML models are implemented by the following JSON schemas:

- {jsonschema-base-url}/AbstractSweIdentifiable.json[AbstractSweIdentifiable.json]
- {jsonschema-base-url}/AbstractDataComponent.json[AbstractDataComponent.json]
- {jsonschema-base-url}/AbstractSimpleComponent.json[AbstractSimpleComponent.json]

[[json_unitreference_obj]]
==== Unit Reference Object

The “UnitReference” object is the partial JSON schema implementation of the “UnitOfMeasure” UML class used in <<uml_quantity_class>> and <<uml_quantityrange_class>>,  and the “UomTime” UML class used in <<uml_time_class>> and <<uml_timerange_class>>, as defining the model for “UnitOfMeasure” and “UomTime” are out of scope for SWE Common. SWE Common only references implementations of “UnitOfMeasure”, like for instance the ones provided by <<UCUM>>.

The schema for this class is provided in {jsonschema-base-url}/basicTypes.json[basicTypes.json] (see #definitions/UnitReference). Further details on the usage of “UnitReference” object can be found in <<json_quantity_obj>> and <<json_time_obj>>.

Examples of references to a unit of measure are provided below:

[[json_boolean_obj]]
==== Boolean Object

The “Boolean” object is the JSON schema implementation of the “Boolean” UML class defined in <<uml_boolean_class>>. The schema for this class is provided in {jsonschema-base-url}/Boolean.json[Boolean.json].

The following snippet shows an example boolean component with an inline value:

[[json_text_obj]]
==== Text Object

The “Text” object is the JSON schema implementation of the “Text” UML class defined in <<uml_text_class>>. The schema for this class is provided in {jsonschema-base-url}/Text.json[Text.json].

Constraints on a “Text” representation are expressed using the <<json_allowedtokens_obj,style=basic%>>.

The following snippets show how the “Text” component can be used to define human readable text fields, as well as any other alpha-numerical properties:

[source%unnumbered,json]
----
include::../schemas/json/examples/spec/text1.json[]
----

[source%unnumbered,json]
----
include::../schemas/json/examples/spec/text2.json[]
----

Constraints can also be used - typically when the component is used as a descriptor - to limit the possible text values, either by enumeration or a regular expression pattern:

[source%unnumbered,json]
----
include::../schemas/json/examples/spec/text3.json[]
----

NOTE: This standard does not define any limit on the size of the text data than can be included as the value of a “Text” component, either inline or as part of a datastream. Implementations are responsible for documenting this upper limit.

The categorical scale is defined either via a code space, an enumeration constraint, or both (in which case the enumeration constraint defines a subset of possible values from a code space):
